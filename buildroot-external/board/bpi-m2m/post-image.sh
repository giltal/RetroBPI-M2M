# Build the FAT32 ROM partition image, then hand off to Buildroot's genimage.sh.
#
# The SD card gets two visible partitions:
#   p1  ext4   rootfs (kernel, DTBs and extlinux live in /boot inside it)
#   p2  FAT32  ROMs, mounted at /opt/roms -- readable/writable from Windows,
#              so ROMs can be dropped straight onto the card
#
# The launcher hardcodes /opt/roms with one subdirectory per system, plus
# _system for favorites/recents/state/theme (see launcher/launcher.c). Those
# directories are pre-created here so the partition is usable the moment the
# card is flashed, without having to boot the board first.

RetroBPI_M2M - ROM partition

Drop ROMs into the folder matching their system, e.g.:

    nes\Super Mario Bros.nes
    gb\Tetris.gb
    genesis\Sonic.md

The launcher scans these folders on startup and hides any that are empty.
_system holds favourites, recents, saved state and theme - leave it alone.

This partition is mounted at /opt/roms on the device.
