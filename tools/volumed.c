/*
 * volumed -- system input daemon: volume on the pad, and a CLEAN POWER OFF.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------- volume ----
 * RetroArch's volume hotkeys adjust its own internal audio_volume, an in-memory
 * dB gain discarded when RetroArch exits, so every launch started at full volume
 * again. It cannot be persisted: config_save_on_exit is off deliberately (it
 * rewrote audio_driver to "null"), RetroArch never logs the volume so there is
 * nothing to scrape, and parallel-n64 SIGSEGVs on teardown so an on-exit save
 * would miss N64 anyway. So drive the ALSA mixer instead -- S35alsa already
 * persists it with alsactl store/restore.
 *
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------- power ----
 * NOTHING was handling KEY_POWER from axp20x-pek. Pressing the button did
 * nothing, so the only way to switch the console off was to hold it until the
 * PMIC cut the rail -- an abrupt power loss with no filesystem flush.
 *
 * That is not cosmetic. It cost the Bluetooth pairing TWICE: the bond directory
 * under /var/lib/bluetooth was written, then lost, and the boot afterwards
 * logged "EXT4-fs: recovery required". Anything ext4 has not committed yet dies
 * with the power -- and that includes .srm game saves written seconds earlier.
 * Reboots issued over SSH were always clean, which is exactly why this took two
 * occurrences to spot: the failure only happens the way a console is actually
 * used.
 *
 * So: KEY_POWER now syncs and powers down properly.
 *
 * Reading these devices alongside RetroArch is safe -- its udev input driver
 * never calls EVIOCGRAB, so every reader gets its own copy of each event.
 *
 * Pad button codes were derived from the device key bitmap and verified against
 * RetroArch's autoconfig (all twelve indices matched; this clone reports BTN_C
 * for A because BTN_EAST is absent). PS is BTN_MODE, volume is the d-pad.
